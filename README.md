[00:00.21] To take my love away
[00:03.68] When I come back around, will I know what to say?
[00:07.86] Said you won't forget my name
[00:10.47] Not today, not tomorrow
[00:14.38] Kind of strange feeling sorrow
[00:17.83] I got change (yup), you could borrow (borrow)
[00:21.71] When I come back around, will I know what to say?
[00:25.44] Not today, maybe tomorrow
[00:37.94] 
[00:29.20] Open up the door, can you open up the door?
[00:33.13] I know you said before, you can't cope with anymore
[00:36.54] You told me it was war, said you'd show me what's in store
[00:40.45] I hope it's not for sure, can you open up the door?
[01:05.95] 
[00:43.84] Did you take my love away from me, me, me, me?
[01:06.84] 
[01:13.51] Saw you sit at the counter when I looked away
[01:17.47] Saw you turn around, but it wasn't your face
[01:20.88] Said, "I need to be alone now, I'm taking a break"
[01:24.26] How come when I return, you were gone away?
[01:28.39] I don't, I don't know why I called
[01:33.87] I don't know you at all
[01:37.25] I don't know you, not at all
[01:51.25] 
[01:43.29] I don't, I don't know why I called
[01:48.44] I don't know you at all
[01:52.12] I don't know you
[02:00.12] 
[01:57.53] Did you take my love away from me, me, me, me?
